# dataset-for-turnning-section
This is an image data set for monitoring the belt conveyor curve section, with a total of 200 images and the size of the image is 640Ã—640. 

The images it contains are mainly from web searches, and some are from the engineering sites done by our laboratory. 

Of course, some data obtained through image enhancement methods are also included. 

After all, the current research work on this scene is relatively small. 

We will also continue to maintain this dataset.
